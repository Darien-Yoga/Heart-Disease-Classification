# Heart-Disease-Classification
Classifies the given dataset whether is it a heart disease or not based on the given features

From this data we can see that cardiovascular disease (Heart Disease) is the most highest death rate in the world in 2017
and the purpose of this Heart Disease Classification is for Classified Patient who had Heart Disease or not having heart disease.
How we classified the patient had Heart Disease or not from dataset that we have got from 
https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci
And the features from this dataset is

![Feature of Heart Disease](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37804147/78467134-b4e27980-7733-11ea-8ee8-c83217e79643.PNG)

1. Age : The person's age in years 
2. Sex : The person's sex (1 = male, 0 = female)
3. cp (Chest Paint): The chest pain experienced (Value 1: typical angina, Value 2: atypical angina, Value 3: non-anginal pain, Value 4: asymptomatic)
4. trestbps (Resting Blood Pressure): The person's resting blood pressure (mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
5. chol (Serum Cholestoral): The person's cholesterol measurement in mg/dl
6. fbs (Fasting Blood Sugar): The person's fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false)
7. restecg (Resting Electrocardiographic Results): Resting electrocardiographic measurement (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria)
8. thalach (maximum heart rate achieved)
9. exang (exercise induced angina)
10. oldpeak (ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest)
11. slope = the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12. ca = number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13. thal = thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
14. target = the value of the model (if the value = 0 (no heart disease), and if the value = 1 (has a heart disease))
